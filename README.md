I am a grade 12 student currently taking the ICS4U course, this is my culminating project.

This project is themed to be a retro first-person shooter. This game recreates the feeling of early 90s shooters using modern Java Swing. The project focuses on mathematical rendering (via Raycasting) combined with standard object-oriented design.
This project was chosen by me as a throwback to my grade 11 ICS3U culminating that I created in June 2024. That project was a simpler Raycasting based game that was also created with Java Swing. The AI integration in this project will allow for a much more complicated game (specifically, a shooter). The math and logic behind Raycasting is also very interesting; utilizing trigonometry and positions based on 2D arrays, it allows us to render a 3D world onto a 2D surface. A shooter itself also brings many possibilities to implement necessary components of the project; there is a large amount of creative liberty and ability to implement unique applications of file I/O, animation, event handling, inheritance, and more. 
This project idea was chosen due to previous familiarity with raycasting, along with the many creative possibilities that come with creating a shooter game.

Project Goals: By the completion of this project, I aim to achieve:
- A Functional 3D Engine: A smooth rendering engine that transforms a 2D grid array into a 3D perspective. With a “mini-map” visible for the player.
- User Authentication: A secure Login System using JComponents and File I/O to save user credentials (including high score).
- Object-Oriented Entity Management: Using inheritance to manage different enemy types (Speed, Tank, Big, Bouncer) with unique stats.
- Game State Management: A complete flow from Login -> Gameplay -> Pause -> Game Over -> High Score tracking.
